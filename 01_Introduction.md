# Introduction #
Google Voice is a free service offered by Google and is designed to help you manage your phone calls. When used for its original intended purpose, Google Voice can add unlimited calling to and from US phone numbers to any landline. With a little more effort, that benefit can be extended to cellphones with "calling circles", or plans that allow a certain number of non-free phone numbers to be converted into free calls. With even more effort and a suitable phone, the feature can be further extended to not only maintain free calling even after a carrier decides those calls should no longer be free, but to also maintain free calling while roaming outside of the United States. Finally, with the greatest amount of effort, one or two lines with unlimited calling 24x7 can be added to any home or business.

Google Voice also supports calling to phone numbers outside the US and Canada. Although while relatively inexpensive, those calls are not free.

## Why this site? ##
While Google does not make Google Voice available via pure data connections for free unlimited calling, this website aims to collect information available on the web for doing just that. We will show you how to add unlimited long distance calling to traditional home phones and regular cellphones and we will also show you how to make and receive unlimited calls using "data only" connections, such as over the Internet or using your cellphone's data plan.

If you are looking to place free unlimited calls over the Internet, please see wiki page 4 for an introduction to VoIP calling and how to add it to Google Voice. If you have a traditional home phone service or a voice-only cellphone and want to add unlimited long distance calling, please visit wiki pages 2 and 3 for those instructions.

Thank you for stopping by, and please enjoy your visit to the site.
