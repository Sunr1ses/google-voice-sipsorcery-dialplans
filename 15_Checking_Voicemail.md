# Introduction #

When Google Voice was first introduced, there was no way to check your voicemail using just a VoIP line. Google has since corrected the situation, and you may check your voicemail by dialing your own number.

There is no need to download a special dialplan for SIP Sorcery. No matter which VoIP service you use, just dial your own Google Voice phone number.
