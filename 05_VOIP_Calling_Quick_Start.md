Before diving into the details about setting up a fully featured VOIP-based solution, let's take a look at two "Quick Start" options that will get you calling right away.

**Note:** Choose **one** of the following two scenarios:

1) Sipgate quick start:
  * Sign up for a free "sipgate one" account at sipgate.com
  * Delete the voicemail feature from your new account
  * Write down your SIP credentials and public phone number for your new account
  * Install a SIP client on a smartphone
  * Configure the SIP client to log into your new sipgate account
  * Log into Google Voice from a full (not mobile) browser
  * Add your sipgate phone number as a managed phone
  * Visit the Google Voice website from your phone's browser
  * Choose "Settings" and set your sipgate number as "This phone's number"

That's it. So long as your SIP client is running on your phone, you will now receive all calls made to your Google Voice number via the SIP client. To place calls, visit the Google Voice website with your phone's browser and either enter a phone number in the field and press Call or choose a contact from your contact list and click the Call button. The SIP client on your phone will ring for an inbound call. Answer the call and you will be connected to the number you entered or selected on the Google Voice web site.

2) SIP Sorcery "GV recipe" quick start:
  * Sign up for a free account at sipsorcery.com, but don't configure anything yet
  * Sign up for a free phone number at www.ipkall.com.
  * Leave the type of forwarding as SIP
  * Enter your new SIP Sorcery username as the username
  * Enter sipsorcery.com as the domain
  * Install a SIP client on your smartphone
  * Configure the SIP client to log into your new SIP Sorcery account
  * Log into Google Voice from a full (not mobile) browser
  * Add your IPKall phone number as a managed phone
  * Return to your SIP Sorcery account page
  * Go to SIP Providers and click Add
  * Choose Google Voice as the type of Provider
  * Enter "MyGoogleVoice" as the provider name
  * Enter your Google userid and password in their respective fields
  * Enter your IPKall phone number as the Callback number
  * Leave the remaining fields as they are and click Save
  * Log into the Google Voice website from your phone
  * Choose "Settings" and set your IPKall number as "This phone's number"

That's it. So long as your SIP client is running on your phone, you will now receive all calls made to your Google Voice number via the SIP client. You must acquaint yourself with dialing via the SIP client you chose to use. On Android, apps are allowed to replace the system dialer, so if you have an old cellphone that is no longer in service, just placing a call like usual will place the call via the SIP client and SIP Sorcery.

If you start to experience the "rnr se key" error when dialing via SIP Sorcery and are unable to resolve it, you can still place calls. Just visit the Google Voice website with your phone's browser and either enter a phone number in the field and press Call or choose a contact from your contact list and click the Call button. The SIP client on your phone will ring for an inbound call. Answer the call and you will be connected to the number you entered or selected on the Google Voice web site.
