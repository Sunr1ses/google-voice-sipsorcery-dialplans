# Introduction #
Voice Over Internet Protocol (Voice Over IP, or simply "VOIP") is a generic term that applies to methods and approaches for allowing users to transmit audio over Internet connections. There are many approaches and technologies applied to implement VOIP, and a few  standards have been developed to ease the interactivity between two or more systems looking to establish a session. One of the most popular approaches is called Session Initiation Protocol, or SIP. SIP is able to establish connections covering a variety of communications, but for the purpose of this discussion, SIP should be thought of as a way to link two or more systems together for the purpose of establishing, maintaining, and terminating phone calls. Generally speaking, a SIP server is a system that either connects to other systems or to end users, either over SIP or through a gateway function that links "digital" phone calls to telephone devices.<p>

What end users tend to think of as a "phone line" can be hosted by a SIP server and lines can be activated or deactivated by an authorized person identified through their login credentials. Just like how people login to Google's properties to check their Gmail account for new email, see their custom dashboard in iGoogle, chat with their friends and family on Google Talk or read the headlines in Google Reader, users of SIP lines can bring up phone lines by using special software to authenticate against a server using unique credentials. When the SIP phone line is activated by the authorized user, phone calls destined for that phone line are presented to the end point the user has designated as their personal interface to the phone line.<p>

Endpoints may take the form of software on a laptop or PC that looks just like a desktop telephone, software that runs on small, handheld computers the size of a cellphone, software that runs on an actual cellphone or (with the help of another device) a standard telephone sitting right on their desk. Without getting too far into details, it is just important to know that what we know as "phone calls" can now freely hop back and forth between the old fashioned wire technology you see in your walls behind the phone plug and computers communicating with each other over the Internet. That's how the phone companies have done it for years, and you are free to join in the fun.<p>

<h1>History</h1>
Since long before Grand Central (the predecessor to Google Voice) hit the scene, services had been popping up, offering low cost phone calls with very low per-minute rates, particularly for international callers. Some companies allowed customers to access their system via regular telephone lines while others only allowed calls to traverse their network in digital form. Since Google Voice offers publicly accessible phone lines and uses high tech approaches to routing and managing phone calls on those lines, its only appropriate that Google would allow a pure IT-based approach to allowing users to connect to their Google Voice phone lines in the same way. Google allowed this for a short time back in 2009. This feature was temporarily reintroduced in 2011, but was quickly disabled once again.<br>

<h1>Why this site?</h1>
The purpose of this site is to restore that functionality for you instead of waiting for Google to reinstate the feature. You will find tips, tricks and a little bit of software we have written to help make Google Voice fully functional as a SIP-compatible phone line. If you are looking to access Google Voice via SIP, please read on for a variety of solutions and approaches available to do exactly that.<br>
